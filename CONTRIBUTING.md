Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep the data science region approachable and respectable. In this guide, you will get an overview of how to contribute to the project.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README). To contribute with our project, here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

-   [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
-   [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

## Getting started

You can contribute to our project in many way! Here are just a few examples of things we're looking for:

-   [Issues](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/pokemon-type-predictor/issues): if there are any problems with our code or documents, we want to know about it! Open an issue and we'll get right on it.
-   [Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests): the best way to make suggestions to our code!

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with any of our documents, search if that issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can always open a new issue.

Before forking and opening a PR, make sure to create issue and have one of the administrators agree that it is an issue. We don't want you to waste any of your time!

#### Solve an issue

Look through existing issues and if any interest you, feel free to open a PR with a fix for our code/documents. You can use the `labels` as filters to search for things you're passionate about.

### Make Changes to our Code

Follow the [contributing to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) guidelines to open your own fork of the project and commit your changes. Then, open your pull request and wait for one of the administrators to review it and hopefully we can incorporate your changes! Don't forget to self-review your update to speed up the review process.

We follow the PEP8 [style guide](https://peps.python.org/) so please ensure code is tidy and easy to read as such.

#### Members

Note: Members of this repo may ask questions, request additional information or suggest changes before the PR can be merged.

After these steps, your PR will be merged! On behalf of the members of this repo, we thank you for your contribution.
