# Communites and Crime - dash
UBC MDS 532 individual project

## Motivation and purpose

[Here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Communites_and_Crime_group8/blob/main/reports/proposal.md) to our milestone proposal.md file of our milestone describing the project.

## Usage

The Explore Crime Rate With Different Factors app is designed to provide users with information about the relationship between the crime rate and different factors. The app contains two reactive elements in the user interface: a scatter plot and a correlation table.

The scatter plot displays the relationship between two factors, which can be selected by the user using the dropdown boxes. The upper left dropdown box and the lower left dropdown box are for selecting the x and y axes on the scatter plot, respectively.

The correlation table shows the correlation between one factor and all the other factors. Users can select the factor of interest from the right dropdown box.
